= From bits to the cloud

This class will examine file system implementation, low-level database storage techniques, and distributed programming. Lectures will cover basic file system structures, journaling and logging, I/O system performance, RAID, the RPC abstraction, and numerous systems illustrating these concepts. Programming assignments will make the topics more concrete. In a final project, students will build a real, functioning UNIX file system. Topics: file systems, distributed computing, replication and consistency, crash recovery. Students will have access to dedicated equipment for the assignments and projects. 

The syllabus of this course is not strictly academic. Most of the material is adapted in such a
way that answers a great lot of questions found in systems interviews. As such, it is modelled after a
Questions 'n Answers structure.


== Physical devices 

==== Introduction
* What is a bit and how is it physically represented
* What is a byte and how is it physically represented
* Performance: Seektime, sequential throughput, # of channels

==== Electromechanical (rotating) devices
* Disks
* Tapes
* Cds
* Floppys, zips 

==== Electrical (non-rotating) devices
* Flash
* SSDs
* NVMe

==== Access
* Controllers vs drives
* Physical Access (host bus adapter)
* Protocols (SCSI, SATA)
* bit preservation (compression / encryption ...)

==== Arrays
* JBOD (Just a bunch of disks), storage pools
* RAID (Local: Host bus adapter)
* SAN (Remote: infiniband, fibre, iSCSI, LUNs)
* Tape library


== Abstractions 

=== Block devices

==== Virtualization
* Geometry-aware addressing
* Block-level addressing
* Device mapper

==== Memory layer
* Staging from Memory to disk (swap)
* virtual memory (pages)
* write(), read(), mmap() ...
* What is page fault


==== Access patterns and workloads
* sequential, matrix, strides (link with device properties)
* side effects: fragmentation, misalignment


=== Filesystem
* Disadvantage of block devices: no hierarchy, no metadata

==== Virtual file system
* Mountpoints for various filesystems (ext4, brfs, FUSE, ...)
* Special purpose (e.g., /proc, overlay)
* POSIX VFS for fs unification
. File descriptors

==== What makes a file
. Logical representation of attributes, data blocks, ....

==== What makes a filesystem
* Metadata (in a filesystem)
. Superblocks, denties, inodes,

* Indexing Structures
. btrees, log-based (in relation to workload/underlying devices)

==== Network Attached Storage
* NFS, SMB
* Clustered
* Distributed

=== Object Storage
* Disadvantage of filesystems : minimum metadata, overhead of block-based access

==== Data placement / addressing
. Content-addressable (Algorithmic calculation of location, replica-aware)
. Lookup (discovery)


=== Databases
* Filesystems/Object storage are excellent on storing data/metadata, but suck on search (querying)

==== Database Query language
* Embedded
* SQL
* Column
* Key/value
* Multi-value



==== Crash resiliency

==== Backup
* full, incremental,  differential
* Periodic data scrubbing

==== Atomic operations
* SoftUpdates
* Journals
* Copy-on-write (to avoid double writes)
* ACID

== Storage in a Data center

==== Distributed Operations
* Sharding
* Anonymizing
* Replication
* Availability (replicas vs erasure coding)
* Anti-Entropy 

==== Architectures
* Shared nothing
* Shared everything
* NUMA / NON-NUMA

==== Node-To-Node communication
* RPC and Serialization
* Connection Multiplexing
* Delivery order (at least one, at most one, exactly one)
* Connection failure: Locking vs leases (timeout)

==== Membership/Service discovery
* DNS
* Lookup (zookeeper)
* Epidemic protocols


=== Software defined storage




== Cloud
* Why move from datacenters to the Cloud
==== Hybrid/MultiCloud
==== Gateways


== Edge
* Why move from Cloud to the Edge







== Excercices

These excercises form a vital part of the course. We suggest that you take a blank piece of paper and jot you answer down, with the number of the question beside it. 

Some questions involve multiple-choice answers. While these are not a good learning aid (continually reading incorrect statements is confusing), many of the exams you will do in the course will use this method of questioning. A good technique in answering multi-choice questions is, prior to reading through the selection, think in your own mind what the asnwer might be. 

Many other excercises contain alternative answers (e.g., may/should) or ask you to fill the blank (e.g., rotating disks are best for .... purposes)


* Difference between blocking and non-blocking operations
* what happens when you type ls in the terminal
* Differences between replication (distributed) and mirroring (local)
* Mention advantages/disadvantages of backup/journal/raid (in terms of "accidental data removal")
* What are the differences between pages and blocks
* Mention advantages / disadvantages for each storage device
* What happens on block misalignment
* What is the difference between RAID and JBOD
* Differences between page fault and swap

== Excercises

===== Exercise 1:
. Use LVM to create a RAID-1 block device
. Create a fuse-based filesystem (bindings for several languages) atop the virtual block device
. Measure with fio the times for metadata operations / data transfers
. Identify impact on various access patterns
. Identify how fuse breaks user data to fs blocks
. Open a file, populate with data, remove file. Why space is still occupied ? (still opened descriptor)

===== Exercise 2:
. Replace the virtual block device of exc1 with distributed replication
. Measure the fuse-based filesystem with IOR (requires mpi)
. Identify that it results to corrupted data
. Expand the fuse-based filesystem to support distributed locking
. Identify significant delays

===== Exercise 3:
. Do not hardcode IP/hostnames/dns entries
. Use Consul/Redis for service discovery
. Add/remove instances, and resuffle the data (e.g., consistent hashing)

= From bits to the cloud

The syllabus of this course is not strictly academic. Most of the material is adapted in such a
way that answers a great lot of questions found in systems interviews. As such, it is modelled after a
Questions 'n Answers structure.



== Host-level storage

=== Physical storage media
* What is a bit and how is it physically represented
* What is a byte and how is it physically represented

* Compare mechanical/electrical, bit preservation, sequential throughput, seek time, # of channels, placement

==== Controller - based
* What is a (physical) device controller ?
* Hard-disks, SSDs, NVM-e, Memory

==== Drive - based
* What are the differences between controllers and drives
* Tapes, cds, floppys, Zips


=== Block devices

==== Access protocol
* Local: Host bus adapter, SCSI, SATA

==== Addressing schema
* Geometry-aware addressing
* Block-level addressing
* RAID
* Device mapper

==== Memory layer
* Staging from Memory to disk (swap)
* virtual memory (pages)
* write(), read(), mmap() ...
* What is page fault

==== Access patterns and workloads
* sequential, matrix, strides
* side effects: fragmentation, misalignment

=== Filesystem
* Disadvantage of block devices: no hierarchy

==== Data versus metadata
* What makes a file
. Logical representation of attributes, data blocks, ....

* Metadata (in a filesystem)
. Superblocks, denties, inodes,

* Structures
. btrees, log-based (in relation to workload/underlying devices)

==== Crash resiliency

==== Backup
* full, incremental,  differential
* Periodic data scrubbing

==== Atomic operations
* Journals
* Copy-on-write (to avoid double writes)
* ACID

===== Virtual file system
* Mountpoints for various filesystems (ext4, brfs, FUSE, ...)
* Special purpose (e.g., /proc, overlay)
* POSIX VFS for fs unification
. File descriptors


===== Exercise 1:
. Use LVM to create a RAID-1 block device
. Create a fuse-based filesystem (bindings for several languages) atop the virtual block device
. Measure with fio the times for metadata operations / data transfers
. Identify impact on various access patterns
. Identify how fuse breaks user data to fs blocks
. Open a file, populate with data, remove file. Why space is still occupied ? (still opened descriptor)


== Storage in a Data center

=== Storage Area Network
* SAN, tape library
* JBOD (Just a bunch of disks), storage pools
* LUNS
* Remote: infiniband, fibre, iSCSI
* SAN-based filesystems


=== Network Attached Storage
* NFS, SMB
* Clustered
* Distributed

==== Node-To-Node communication
* RPC and Serialization
* Connection Multiplexing
* Delivery order (at least one, at most one, exactly one)
* Connection failure: Locking vs leases (timeout)

==== Distributed Operations
* Sharding
* Anonymizing
* Replication
* Availability (replicas vs erasure coding)


=== Software defined storage

==== Architectures
* Shared nothing
* Shared everything
* NUMA / NON-NUMA

==== Data placement / addressing
. Content-addressable (Algorithmic calculation of location, replica-aware)
. Lookup (discovery)

==== Membership/Service discovery
* DNS
* Lookup (zookeeper)
* Epidemic protocols

=== APIs
* Embedded
* SQL
* Column
* Key/value
* Multi-value







===== Exercise 2:
. Replace the virtual block device of exc1 with distributed replication
. Measure the fuse-based filesystem with IOR (requires mpi)
. Identify that it results to corrupted data
. Expand the fuse-based filesystem to support distributed locking
. Identify significant delays




===== Exercise 3:
. Do not hardcode IP/hostnames/dns entries
. Use Consul/Redis for service discovery
. Add/remove instances, and resuffle the data (e.g., consistent hashing)


== Cloud
* Why move from datacenters to the Cloud

=== Gateways

=== Hybrid/MultiCloud



== Questions

* Difference between blocking and non-blocking operations
* what happens when you type ls in the terminal
* Differences between replication (distributed) and mirroring (local)
* Mention advantages/disadvantages of backup/journal/raid (in terms of "accidental data removal")
* What are the differences between pages and blocks
* Mention advantages / disadvantages for each storage device
* What happens on block misalignment
* What is the difference between RAID and JBOD
* Differences between page fault and swap
